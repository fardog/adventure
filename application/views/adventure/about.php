<p><strong>Adventure</strong> is a media mashup engine. You mix audio, video, and images, then serialize them into &#8220;choose your own adventure&#8221;-type stories. You can embed media from <a href="http://youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube</a>, <a href="http://imgur.com" target="_blank">imgur</a>, <a href="http://soundcloud.com/" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>, and fill the gaps with your own text. Then link and branch your content into multipath stories for everyone to enjoy.</p>

<p>There's a list of adventures below, or the menu in the top right if you want to start a new adventure. All adventures are editable by <em>everyone</em> by default, so register an account if you'd like to create a &#8220;locked&#8221; adventure that only you can control. Read the <a href="/help/">help</a>, and submit bugs and issues to the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/milkandtang/adventure/issues" target="_blank">tracker</a>.</p>
